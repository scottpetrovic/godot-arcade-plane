# Enemy Types

## 1. Alien Invaders

These are the primary antagonists and the most frequent enemies players will face. They are highly advanced and employ a variety of tactics and ships.

### Alien Fighter Classes

These enemies are the bread and butter of combat. They will appear in different configurations and progressively challenge the player more.

#### Scout Fighters

- **Appearance:** Small, agile crafts with sleek, angular designs.
- **Behavior:** Scouts are fast and lightly armored. They usually appear in swarms and rely on speed rather than strength, engaging the player in dogfights. Often equipped with basic plasma weapons and are highly evasive.
- **Role in Gameplay:** Early-game enemy. These ships are mainly used to harass players and force them to use evasive maneuvers.

#### Interceptor Drones

- **Appearance:** Unmanned alien drones with compact, insect-like appearances.
- **Behavior:** Interceptors are fast and agile, often attacking from the sides or from below. They utilize energy projectiles and short-range EMP blasts to temporarily disable player weapons or shields.
- **Role in Gameplay:** They can overwhelm players with speed and numbers, providing more difficulty as they appear in larger groups. EMP forces the player to rely on manual dodging for a few seconds.

#### Void Strikers

- Appearance: Dark, angular ships that seem to absorb light.
- Behavior: These fighters can create small, localized "void zones" that nullify energy weapons and obscure vision. They fight by darting in and out of these zones.
- Role in Gameplay: Forces players to rely on different weapon types and adapt to rapidly changing battlefield conditions.


#### Heavy Gunships

- **Appearance:** Large, hulking crafts with multiple turrets and missile pods.
- **Behavior:** Gunships are heavily armored but slow. They provide air superiority with long-range bombardment, forcing the player to take them down strategically (hitting weak spots or using upgraded weapons).
- **Role in Gameplay:** Mid-game enemies that introduce new challenges. Players must approach with caution and precision, often needing to outmaneuver their heavy firepower.

#### Cloaked Fighters

- **Appearance:** Sleek, almost ethereal ships with a semi-invisible, shimmering appearance when cloaked.
- **Behavior:** These ships rely on stealth and ambush tactics, decloaking to strike before retreating. Their main weapon is an energy pulse that causes high damage but has a long cooldown.
- **Role in Gameplay:** Late-game enemies. They force the player to rely on radar and reflexes, creating tense moments where players can only briefly see their enemies.

### Alien Capital Ships

The more advanced and larger enemy ships serve as mini-bosses or major threats during specific missions.

#### Battleships

- **Appearance:** Massive, elongated ships with multiple gun turrets, energy shields, and fighter bays.
- **Behavior:** Battleships act as mobile command centers, deploying smaller fighter classes while engaging the player directly with heavy plasma cannons and missiles. Some parts of the ship can be destroyed to disable specific weapons or shield generators.
- **Role in Gameplay:** Major objective in specific missions, like escorting allied bombers or defending carriers. These ships require precise, tactical attacks to disable critical systems before they are destroyed.

#### Mothership (Final Boss)

- **Appearance:** A colossal ship the size of a small city, with a biomechanical structure. Covered in alien flora, glowing energy cores, and massive weapon batteries.
- **Behavior:** The mothership is a flying fortress, capable of deploying waves of fighters and engaging the player with devastating, long-range weapons. During the final act, it serves as the player's primary target, requiring multiple phases to defeat (taking out shield generators, disabling weapon systems, etc.).
- **Role in Gameplay:** The final battle. It's an epic, multi-phase encounter, involving not just the player, but a full fleet of allied forces. Players must navigate tight spaces, avoid massive energy beams, and destroy key points.

### Special Alien Enemies

#### Bio-Mechanical Hybrids

- **Appearance:** A fusion of alien technology and organic matter, these creatures look like a cross between an aircraft and an insect. Pulsating veins of energy run along their bodies.
- **Behavior:** Hybrids tend to be more erratic, combining biological instincts with the precision of alien technology. They regenerate over time, making them harder to take down permanently unless destroyed quickly.
- **Role in Gameplay:** Introduced mid-to-late game, they add a layer of unpredictability. Players must focus fire to destroy them before they regenerate health.

## 2. Kaiju Monsters

The kaiju serve as large, unpredictable threats, often functioning as mission bosses or obstacles. They are less frequent than the alien enemies but provide some of the game's most cinematic moments.

### Kaiju Classes

#### Gargantor (Giant Reptilian Kaiju)

- **Appearance:** A massive, dinosaur-like creature with tough, scaled skin, and large spiked fins running along its back.
- **Behavior:** Gargantor attacks cities and military installations, smashing buildings and swatting at aircraft. It can breathe fire, creating zones of denial for players, and it occasionally emits a deafening roar that disorients nearby aircraft (shaking HUD).
- **Weakness:** Exposed underbelly when it rears up to unleash its roar. Players can use timing and skill to land hits during this vulnerable phase.
- **Role in Gameplay:** Early-mid boss. Defending cities from Gargantor introduces large-scale destruction where players must also prevent collateral damage.

#### Electro-Kraken (Kaiju from the Deep)

- **Appearance:** A gigantic octopus-like creature with bioluminescent spots along its tentacles. It emits electrical pulses that arc through the water and air.
- **Behavior:** The Kraken stays underwater but uses its tentacles to attack surface vessels and planes. It can generate EMP waves, temporarily disabling aircraft systems. The player has to dodge these attacks and hit its exposed head or tentacle weak points.
- **Weakness:** Tentacles and head. After a few hits, the Kraken retreats, forcing players to fend off alien fighters until it reemerges.
- **Role in Gameplay:** Mid-game boss, appearing in water-based missions. Players must coordinate with their squadron to fend off the Kraken's attacks while dodging electrical pulses.

#### Titanosaurus (Final Kaiju Threat)

- **Appearance:** Towering even over skyscrapers, this kaiju has a serpentine body with thick armor plating and sharp, bladed appendages. It moves slowly but can devastate everything in its path.
- **Behavior:** Titanosaurus moves methodically through urban landscapes, obliterating entire blocks as it heads towards critical infrastructure. Its tail can create shockwaves, and it can generate massive energy blasts from its mouth.
- **Weakness:** Its back is covered in energy cores that power its beam weapon. Players must destroy these cores while avoiding its tail and energy blasts.
- **Role in Gameplay:** End-game boss or part of the final battle, creating an overwhelming sense of scale. Players must coordinate with ground forces and attack weak points to bring it down.

## 3. Environmental Enemies/Challenges

Beyond direct enemies, the world itself can present hazards that the player must avoid or navigate through.

### Alien Drones

- **Appearance:** Small, spherical drones that serve as automatic defenses for larger alien ships.
- **Behavior:** Drones zip around, laying down mines or deploying energy shields to block player progress.
- **Role in Gameplay:** These serve as hazards in space or near alien bases, forcing the player to fly carefully and dodge obstacles.

### Kaiju Aftermath Zones

- **Description:** As a result of kaiju attacks, there are heavily damaged environments that players need to navigate through. Collapsing buildings, sudden dust clouds, and electrical storms (caused by kaiju) act as environmental hazards.
- **Role in Gameplay:** These zones introduce challenges where players must be cautious and aware of their surroundings, avoiding environmental hazards.

## Conclusion

This variety of enemy types—from fast alien scouts to gigantic kaiju—can help keep the player engaged throughout the game. Each enemy type brings new challenges that require different strategies, encouraging players to upgrade their aircraft and refine their skills as they progress. These enemies also tie into the story, with the aliens representing a technological threat and the kaiju representing a primal, unstoppable force.
