# Testing out HTML 5 export
This is a simple HTTPS server to test out Godot exports. HTML5 exports need HTTPS servers to load the resources. You cannot just double click the HTML file to load the demo.

## Instructions
Drop your web export folder into this project so it has its own directory. This will keep it separate from other files.


Run the following commands:
    npm install
    npm run dev

There will be a certificate popup. Accept this as this will allow the HTTPS to work.

Change the URL in the web address bar. Point it to your web export folder and HTML file to load the project.
